# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The program was designed to be used with a store's sales. The store would record each item sold throughout a day and then use the program to display a list of the number of times each item was purchased, or how many times a specific item was purchased. This output would then be used to determine how to organize the store.


What did you do particularly well?

I did pretty well with input validatation. Particularly by using one function for multiple types of input.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could enhance my code by taking an active role in memory management. Doing so could reduce resource usage and speed up the program. However, it would potentially introduce vulnerabilities or bugs and would record much more work and bug testing.


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I found the input validation for multiple types of input the most challenging. Most of the reason I found this challenging was because I wanted it to be one function. I overcame this by looking into how to return different types from one function and discovered structs. I am still using the same tools and resources I have been previously, but at a more advanced level. The key is knowing the proper terminology for stackoverflow or google.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I would say utilizing multiple languages in one program and just the general knowledge with C++.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I used understandable names for variables, structs, functions, etc. That makes it easier to read. If code was used repeatedly I made a function out of it. I added descriptive comments for most lines and explained what the purpose was of that code in the overall scheme of the program or section of code.
